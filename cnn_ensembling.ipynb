    "## Introduction\n",
    "\"In statistics and machine learning, ensemble methods use multiple learning algorithms to obtain better predictive performance than could be obtained from any of the constituent learning algorithms alone. Unlike a statistical ensemble in statistical mechanics, which is usually infinite, a machine learning ensemble consists of only a concrete finite set of alternative models, but typically allows for much more flexible structure to exist among those alternatives.\" \\[[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_learning)\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "The main motivation for using an ensemble is to find a hypothesis that is not necessarily contained within the hypothesis space of the models from which it is built. Empirically, ensembles tend to yield better results when there is a significant diversity among the models. \\[[2](http://jair.org/papers/paper614.html)\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look at results of any big machine learning competition, you will most likely find that the top results are achieved by an ensemble of models rather than a single model. For instance, the top-scoring single model architecture at [ILSVRC2015](http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2015/results) is on place 13. Places 1-12 are taken by various ensembles.\n",
    "\n",
    "I haven't seen a tutorial or documentation on how to use several neural networks in an ensemble, so I decided to share the way I do it. I will be using [Keras](https://keras.io/), specifically its [Functional API](https://keras.io/models/model/), to recreate three small CNNs (compared to ResNet50, Inception etc.) from relatively well-known papers. I will train each model separately on [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) training dataset. \\[[3](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/learning-features-2009-TR.pdf)\\] Then each model will be evaluated using the test set. After that, I will put all three models in an ensemble and evaluate it. It is expected that the ensemble will perform better on a test set than any single model in the ensemble separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different types of ensembles; stacking is one of them. It is one of the more general types and can theoretically represent any other ensemble technique. Stacking involves training a learning algorithm to combine the predictions of several other learning algorithms. \\[[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_learning)\\] For the sake of this example, I will use one of the simplest forms of Stacking, which involves taking an average of outputs of models in the ensemble. Since averaging doesn’t take any parameters, there is no need to train this ensemble (only its models)."

Then the `GlobalAveragePooling2D()` layer computes spatial average of these 10 feature maps, which means that its output is just a vector with a lenght 10. After that, a softmax activation is applied to that vector. As you can see, this method is in some way analogous to using FC layers at the top of the model. You can read more about global pooling layers and their advantages in Network in Network paper. \\[[5](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.4400)\\]\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "To reiterate what was said in the introduction: every model has its own weaknesses. The reasoning behind using an ensemble is that by stacking different models representing different hypotheses about the data, we can find a better hypothesis that is not in the hypothesis space of the models from which the ensemble is built.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using a very basic ensemble, a lower error rate was achieved than when a single model was used in most cases. This proves effectiveness of ensembling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, there are some practical considerations to keep in mind when using an ensemble for your machine learning task. Since ensembling means stacking multiple models together, it also means that the input data needs to be forward-propagated for each model. This increases the amount of compute that needs to be performed and, consequently, evaluation (predicition) time. Increased evaluation time is not critical if you use an ensemble in research or in a Kaggle competition. However, it is a very critical factor when designing a commercial product. Another consideration is increased size of the final model which, again, might be a limiting factor for ensemble use in a commercial product."
